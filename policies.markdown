## Cancellation Policy

Free cancellations and rescheduling can be made up to 24 hours before the booking time, after which you will be liable for a fee. A cancellation incurs a fee of the originally booked servcice, whilst rescheduling the booking reduces the fee to 50 percent of the original booking. This does not subsidise future bookings.

## Refund and Dispute Policy

To discuss an issue with a service that has been carried out, please contact me at reece.watson@rwmvaleting.co.uk

Please include in the email:  
1. The date of service.
1. The details of the car worked on, including the number plate.
1. The invoice or the payment date and the amount paid.
1. Description of the issue and any other important information, such as picture evidence.

By default, when a service is carried out, you are not entitled to a refund. However, if we deem your complaint to be valid, we will consider a partial refund for the issue raised. Alternatively, and our preference, is a free correction of the issue, as long as it is not caused after the service was completed. 

If a service is interrupted, you are only liable to the extent of the service carried out. For example, if only the exterior is cleaned in a valet package because of an emergency, the charge would be half of the original service cost. You would be liable for the rest of the cost if a rearranged date is agreed upon, or if a new service is booked, you will be liable for the full cost of that new service upon completion.
