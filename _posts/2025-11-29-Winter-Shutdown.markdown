Dear Customers,
 
We would like to inform you that on the **6th of December**, RWM Valeting will be entering a winter shutdown period. 

This is due to weather limitations and other contributing factors. The plan at this stage is to resume operations in late March.

If you have had a booking within the three month period leading up to the 6th December, you would still be eligible for a loyalty discount. Because of the winter shutdown period, this would impact your ability to benefit from this arrangement. Therefore, any remaining discount period left after the 6th December will be resumed after the shutdown; **the discount will not expire over the winter**. If you have any more questions or clarifications that you would like, please feel free to reach out. 

Thank you all for your custom during this past year.

Kind Regards,

Reece Watson  
RWM Valeting
